# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

## Technical Tasks
---
- [X] TASK 1

* Instrument our backend flask application to use Open Telemetry (OTEL) with Honeycomb.io as the provider.

Opentelementry in the Requirement.txt

Honeycomb Provider

![app.py Config](../images/app.py-Honeycomb.png)

![Other Configurations in app.py](../images/app.py-Honeycomb.png)

* Run queries to explore traces within Honeycomb.io

Here are the results of the trace queries:

![Querry 1 - Taces](../images/Honeycmb-querry.png)

![Querry 2 - percentile](../images/Honey-querry2.png)

While running the home-activities logger querry, an error data occured 

![Error Querry](../images/Honeycomb-querry.png)

After hours of debugging, it was found out to be a boolean written instead of a string data in the config file.
And this was corrected as seen in the picture below

- [X] TASK 2

* Instrument AWS X-Ray into backend flask application.

* Configure and provision X-Ray daemon within docker-compose and send data back to X-Ray API.

![X-ray Daemon Console](../images/X-rayDaemon-console.png)

* Observe X-Ray traces within the AWS Console
It came back with some traces


After this task, I ran out of Gitpod Credit and had to set up a Codespace 
 I set it following the instructions. Here is a snippet of that:
